# What the project does, in plain English

**A simulated closed-loop DBS system that compares a standard beta-threshold controller against a lightweight HDC-based controller for detecting and suppressing Parkinson-like beta oscillations.**

1. **Brain simulator**

A mathematical model that produces neural signals. We will tune it so it can behave in two modes:

* a more normal mode
* a Parkinson-like abnormal oscillation mode

2. **State detector**

A lightweight algorithm that watches the simulated brain signal and decides whether the system is currently in a bad pathological state.

3. **Stimulator/controller**

If the detector thinks the brain has entered the bad state, it turns on simulated deep brain stimulation for a short burst to knock the system back out of that state.

Then we compare 4 strategies:

* do nothing
* always stimulate
* stimulate when classical beta-power threshold says to
* stimulate when our HDC detector says to

The real question is:

**Can our lightweight HDC detector control the system about as well as the standard beta-threshold method, while still being simple and cheap to run?**

# Layman analogy

"A smart thermostat for a machine that sometimes vibrates badly"

* The **simulator** is the machine.
* The **signal** is a sensor reading from the machine.
* The **detector** decides whether the machine is vibrating in a dangerous pattern.
* The **stimulator** is a corrective pulse that calms the machine down.

We want to know whether our custom detector can do as well as the standard detector.

# High-level implementation plan

## Phase 1: Build the simulated brain

We first need a working mathematical simulation that can reliably produce:

* a normal regime
* an abnormal Parkinson-like regime with strong beta oscillations

### What we implement

* ODE model of the STN-GPe loop, with optional extension to more populations later
* chunked simulation loop so we can inject control decisions while the sim is running
* LFP-like population signal extracted from the model

### Output of this phase

* clean healthy signal
* clean pathological signal
* PSD plots showing beta-band is stronger in the pathological case

### Why this matters

If the simulation does not clearly produce the two regimes, everything downstream becomes meaningless.

---

## Phase 2: Build the HDC detector offline

Before doing any closed-loop control, we test whether the HDC encoder can even distinguish healthy vs pathological windows.

### What we implement

* signal windowing
* normalization
* quantization into bins
* HDC encoding:

  * value hypervectors
  * position hypervectors
  * binding
  * bundling
* healthy and pathological prototype vectors
* similarity scoring and margin:

  * similarity to healthy prototype
  * similarity to pathological prototype
  * margin = pathological similarity minus healthy similarity

### Data used

We test on:

* healthy windows
* pathological windows
* onset windows
* recovery windows
* moderate-coupling ambiguous windows

### Output of this phase

* histograms or plots showing class separation
* evidence that HDC margin correlates with beta activity

### Why this matters

This tells us whether the detector is learning something useful before we wire it into control.

---

## Phase 3: Validate stimulation in open loop

Before the controller decides when to stimulate, we must prove stimulation itself actually works.

### What we implement

* stimulation pulse train at 130 Hz
* fixed stimulation epoch, like 200 ms
* injection into the model as an external current/input

### Output of this phase

* traces showing pathological beta activity gets suppressed when stimulation is applied continuously

### Why this matters

If stimulation cannot suppress the bad state, there is no point building adaptive control logic.

---

## Phase 4: Build the closed-loop controllers

Now we connect the detectors to the simulator.

### Controller A: Classical baseline

* measure beta-band power from the LFP signal
* stimulate when beta power crosses threshold

### Controller B: HDC controller

* compute HDC margin from the latest signal window
* smooth margin over time
* use hysteresis:

  * turn on above one threshold
  * turn off below a lower threshold
* apply lockout after each stimulation epoch

### Phase Output

* time plots showing:

  * simulated LFP
  * beta power
  * HDC margin
  * stimulation on/off timeline

Significance: This is the core system behavior.

---

## Phase 5: Run the 4-condition comparison

We run the same pathological scenario through all 4 strategies:

1. no stimulation
2. continuous DBS
3. classical beta-threshold aDBS
4. HDC-triggered aDBS

### Metrics we compute

#### Control performance

* average beta power
* pathological occupancy
* suppression latency

#### Stimulation efficiency

* total pulses
* duty cycle

#### System efficiency

* decision time per window
* memory footprint

### Output of this phase

* final comparison table
* hero figure for presentation/report

# Success Criteria 

A successful project does not need to prove HDC is better in every way.

Success is:

* the simulator reliably enters a pathological beta state
* stimulation can suppress it
* the classical controller works
* the HDC controller also works
* you compare them fairly
* you can clearly say whether HDC is competitive, worse, or better

That is already a strong engineering result.

---

# Main technical risks

## Risk 1: simulation tuning takes too long

Fix:

* simplify to STN-GPe only
* stop chasing biological perfection

## Risk 2: stimulation does not suppress the bad regime

Fix:

* tune amplitude, pulse width, target population, epoch duration

## Risk 3: HDC classifier looks good offline but fails online

Fix:

* use transitional windows
* use smoothing + hysteresis
* inspect recovery behavior carefully

## Risk 4: “lighter weight” claim is not true

Fix:

* do not assume it
* measure it honestly

---

# What each controller is really doing

## Classical beta-threshold controller

This is the standard rule-based approach.

It says:

* “If beta activity is above threshold, stimulate.”

Very interpretable and simple.

## HDC controller

This is a pattern-based approach.

It says:

* “This recent signal pattern looks more like the pathological prototype than the healthy prototype, so stimulate.”

It may capture richer temporal structure than a simple beta threshold.

# MVP goals 

* 2-population STN-GPe simulator
* one LFP surrogate
* one classical beta-threshold controller
* one simple HDC controller
* one comparison notebook
* one final table with metrics
